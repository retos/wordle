## WordleSolver

The App [WordleSolver](/WordleSolver) helps you to solve the online game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)  
It uses a word library from wordle.

## AutomaticWordleSolver
[AutomaticWordleSolver](/AutomaticWordleSolver) has still room for improvement current status:
```
Automatic Wordle-Solver!
All done. Guesscount 8957, games played 2315, average 3.87
worst word is catch with 10 tries
```
This app goes to a randomized list of all words from wordle and solves them.

## WordlePuzzleGenerator
The [WordlePuzzleGenerator](/WordlePuzzleGenerator) takes the input list and generates randomized version of it. For what purpose you ask? Currently none, I first thought of using different word-dictionaries. But abandoned this. For the AutomaticWordleSolver it is irrelevant if the list is randomized or not.

## WordleSolverLibrary
The [WordleSolverLibrary](/WordleSolverLibrary) holds the class Solver and Game. This project is reverenced by the others to do the heavy lifting.
